## Hey there, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Trent, a software developer with a passion for creation.

When I first found out about coding- I knew it was for me. 
I love being able to express my creativity through the code I write, and even more, finding solutions to unorthodoxed problems!
That's why I can't stop learning- if there's an idea in my head, I'll do whatever it takes to bring it to fruition, even if that means learning a new language or framework.

These days, I am super passionate about applying code to finance, autonomous driving, and social media applications, to name a few!
