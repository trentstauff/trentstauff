## Hey there, nice to meet you! 👋
---
### I'm Trent (he/him), a software developer with a passion for creation.

When I first started coding- I knew it was for me. 
I love being able to express my creativity through the code I write and love to find awesome solutions to unorthodoxed problems! </br></br>
That's why I can't stop learning- if there's an idea in my head, I'll do whatever it takes to bring it to fruition, even if that means learning a new language or framework. </br>

These days, I am super passionate about applying code to finance, autonomous driving, and social media applications, to name a few! </br></br>

### Quick Facts

* 👨‍💻 I enjoy all types of development, and love trying new things. From fullstack, to low-latency concurrent C++ work, to Python algorithmic trading bots, and even mobile dev, I've done it!
* 📚 I'm studying **Computer Engineering @ the University of Waterloo** (expected 2024), currently in my 2B term.
* ⚙️ I've interned twice at **BlackBerry** 🔒 and am currently wrapping up my term at **TD Securitie**s 💸, both as a **Software Engineering Intern.**
* 🏈 I love playing and watching sports, such as football, hockey, spikeball, and even foosball (I'd say I'm dangerously good at foosball, let's 1v1 👀?)
* 🐕 I have a chocolate lab Harley, and absolutely love animals!

I'd love to hear more about yourself! If you'd like to talk opportunities, or even just want to chat, feel free to connect with me on my LinkedIn below!
