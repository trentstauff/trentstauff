### hey there ðŸ‘‹

## i'm a software developer with a passion for creation.

i love finding solutions for unorthodox problems and thinking outside the box!
whether this means starting a new project, contributing to open source, or participating in a wide variety of hackathons, my passion for continuous learning shines above all else.
