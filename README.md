## Hey there, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Trent, a software developer with a passion for creation.

When I first found out about coding- I knew it was for me. 
I love being able to express my creativity through the code I write, and even more, finding solutions to unorthodoxed problems! </br></br>
That's why I can't stop learning- if there's an idea in my head, I'll do whatever it takes to bring it to fruition, even if that means learning a new language or framework. </br>

These days, I am super passionate about applying code to finance, autonomous driving, and social media applications, to name a few! </br></br>

### Quick Facts

* I enjoy all types of development, and love trying new things. From fullstack, to low-latency concurrent C++ work, to Python algorithmic trading bots, and even mobile dev, I've done it!
* I'm studying Computer Engineering @ the University of Waterloo (expected 2024), currently in my 2B term.
* I've interned twice at BlackBerry ðŸ”’ and am currently wrapping up my term at TD Securities ðŸ’¸, both as a Software Engineering Intern.
* I love playing and watching sports, such as football, hockey, spikeball, and even foosball (I'd say I'm dangerously good at foosball, let's 1v1 ðŸ‘€?)
* I have a chocolate lab Harley, and absolutely love animals!

I'd love to chat more with yourself and get to know you. Feel free to connect with me on my LinkedIn below, and say you're from my GitHub page if you see this!
